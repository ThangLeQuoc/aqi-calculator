### Foreword
All methods, constraints use in this project follows **US EPA AQI Calculation Method** (which includes breakpoint table and calculation formulas) . Since each country issues different AQI calculation methods, using this package might be inappropriate, consider your usage.

This project is intended to community target for free use. The author is not associated with USA government, nor United States Environmental Protection Agency (a.k.a **US EPA**)

## Highlights
- Calculate AQI from raw concentration
- The result from calculation includes Air Quality Index, AQI Category, General Message, Specific Health Effects Statements for the pollutant and the corresponding guidance message.
- Support Nowcast Concentration

### Support the following pollutants

| Pollutant  | Scientific name| Unit of Measurement |Input Code Usage |Regular Calculation Support |Nowcast Support | Health Effects Statements | Guidance Message|
| ---- |:-------------:|:-------------:|:-------------:|:-------------:|-------------:|-------------:|-------------:|
| PM10      |  10 μm Particle Pollutant  | μg/m3| PM10 | :heavy_check_mark:| :heavy_check_mark:|:heavy_check_mark:|:heavy_check_mark:|
| PM2.5      |  2.5 μm Particle Pollutant  | μg/m3| PM2.5 |  :heavy_check_mark:| :heavy_check_mark:|:heavy_check_mark:|:heavy_check_mark:|
| O3     |  Ozone  | ppb| O3 | :heavy_check_mark:| :heavy_check_mark:|:heavy_check_mark:|:heavy_check_mark:|
| CO     |  Carbon Monoxide  | ppb| CO | :heavy_check_mark:|:x:|:heavy_check_mark:|:heavy_check_mark:|
| SO2     |  Sulfur Dioxide  | ppb| SO2 | :heavy_check_mark:| :x:|:heavy_check_mark:|:heavy_check_mark:|
| NO2     |  Nitrogen Dioxide  | ppb| NO2 | :heavy_check_mark:| :x:|:heavy_check_mark:|:heavy_check_mark:|
## Installation
### Using Maven Dependency
```
<!-- https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.github.thanglequoc/aqi-calculator -->
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.github.thanglequoc</groupId>
    <artifactId>aqi-calculator</artifactId>
    <version>1.2.3</version>
</dependency>
```
Or for other stuff like Gradle, SBT, Ivy,.. you may find it on [Maven Central Repository](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.github.thanglequoc/aqi-calculator/1.2.1)
### Using Plug-n-play jar file:
Grab the target jar in `target-jar` folder and add the jar to your project.

## Quick Usage
### Note
From version _1.2.3_, the input string as pollutant is replaced by _Pollutant_ enum class for strong
consistence.

#### For Regular AQI Calculation
##### Using AQIResult Object:
```
AQICalculator calculator = AQICalculator.getAQICalculatorInstance();
AQIResult result = calculator.getAQI(Pollutant.PM10, 99);
```

Now `AQIResult` store all the related information that you might need, query them by the following methods
* Get the Air Quality Index (AQI)

```result.getAqi();```
>73

```result.getConcentration();```

For _Nowcast_ calculation, this will be the **Nowcast Concentration**
>99.0

* Get the AQI Category

```result.getCategory();```
>Moderate

* Get the general message of the AQI Category

`result.getGeneralMessage();`

>Unusually sensitive people should consider reducing prolonged or heavy outdoor exertion
* Get the health effects statement for the pollutant with that level

`result.getHealthEffectsStatement();`
>Respiratory symptoms possible in unusually sensitive individuals; possible aggravation of heart or lung disease in people with cardiopulmonary disease and older adults

* Get the guidance message for the pollutant with that level

`result.getGuidanceStatement();`
>Unusually sensitive people should consider reducing prolonged or heavy exertion


#### For Nowcast AQI Calculation

~~~~
/* Example Data for Nowcast PM10 12h period - 64, 63, 72, 77, 65, 61, 70, 71, 64, 57, 58, 64 */
AQICalculator calculator = AQICalculator.getAQICalculatorInstance();

double[] data = { 64, 63, 72, 77, 65, 61, 70, 71, 64, 57, 58, 64 };`
AQIResult result = calculator.getNowcastAQI("PM10", data);

result.getAqi();
~~~~
>57

The first value in the array is the avg value in the current hour, and the upcoming element in the array represent one step hour before current hour.

If the hour doesn't have data, replace missing data in the hour with **-1**
##### Example Nowcast Dataset for PM10: (have some missing data in hour)
| Hour | Avg Concentration
| ---- |:-------------:|
| 14      | 64 ppb |
| 13      | 63 ppb |
| 12      | ---- |
| 11      | 77 ppb |
| 10      | 65 ppb |
| 9      | ---- |
| 8      | 70 ppb |
| 7      | 71 ppb |
| 6      | ---- |
| 5      | 57 ppb|
| 4      | 58 ppb|
| 3      | 64 ppb|

Presume that you want to calculate Nowcast AQI for PM10 at **14**, the data array should be

~~~~
double[] data = { 64, 63, -1, 77, 65, -1, 70, 71, -1, 57, 58, 64 };`
AQIResult result = calculator.getNowcastAQI("PM10", data);
result.getAqi();
~~~~
>56



# AQI Calculation Turtorial
## US EPA AQI Breakpoint

## Calculation Formula

The AQI is the highest value calculated for each pollutant as follows:

1. 	Identify the highest concentration among all of the monitors within each reporting area and truncate as follows:

2. 	Using US EPA AQI Breakpoint, find the two breakpoints that contain the concentration.
3. 	Using AQI Equation , calculate the index.
4. 	Round the index to the nearest integer.

### Nowcast for PM and Ozone
The concentration of PM10, PM2.5 is so dynamic since wind can completely clean the air in less
than 30 minutes, or a wildfire can raise the concentration with a very fast rate in an hour. So
Nowcast is introduced, it mainly focus on detect the average changing of the period hour and
perform counter balancing.

#### Nowcast Rules

##### Handling Missing data
To compute a valid NowCast, you must have at least two of the most recent 3 hours
